# FastAPI + React Paint-by-Numbers Project
## Overview
This project combines FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend to create a web application that transforms images into drawings. Using K-Means clustering and closing morphology, the application generates outlines suitable for paint-by-numbers.

## Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images via the frontend.
Image Processing: The backend processes the images to create outlines using K-Means clustering and closing morphology.
Paint-by-Numbers: The processed image is converted into a paint-by-numbers template.
Visualization: Users can visualize and download the paint-by-numbers template.
## Technologies Used
Backend: FastAPI
Frontend: React
Image Processing: OpenCV, scikit-learn
